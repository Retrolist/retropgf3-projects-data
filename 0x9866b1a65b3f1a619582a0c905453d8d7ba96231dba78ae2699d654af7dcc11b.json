  "impactDescription": "I was one of the first airdrop holders, and I had already experienced L2 deposits and withdrawals before the airdrop. At that time, the speed and fees for withdrawals were very high. After my first batch of airdrops arrived, I often participated in community voting and paid attention to the long-term development of the project. At the same time, after experiencing the dapp, I would share it with other netizens, such as bungee, fx, etc.",
