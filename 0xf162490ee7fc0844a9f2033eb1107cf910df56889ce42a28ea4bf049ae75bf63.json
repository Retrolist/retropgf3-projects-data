  "impactDescription": "Waffle has enabled teams, including OP Labs to more quickly and reliably write smart contact tests, making applications safer for users. \n\n- Waffle was used by over 70k projects including Optimism, Uniswap, Aave, 0x, Balancer, zkSync, Cosmos, ENS, Gnosis, SushiSwap, Loopring, Aragon, PoolTogether, and Gitcoin. \n\n- Here is the full list of projects using Waffle at this point in time: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-waffle?activeTab=dependents",
  "contributionDescription": "We are the creators and maintainers of Waffle, a framework for testing smart contracts. \n\n- Multiple repositories in the Optimism ecosystem are dependent on Waffle. \n- Waffle provides a clean and simplified way to write tests for smart contracts. \n- It abstracts away much of the boilerplate code, making it easier to focus on the actual test logic and improving overall ecosystem security and reliability. \n- Waffle is one of the most popular testing libraries. It has helped many projects and developers keep their smart contracts secure and well-tested. \n",
