  "impactDescription": "These efforts enriched the project's legacy, fostered discussion culture, and either resolved practical issues or explored solutions.\n\nIn the Wanna-TechNerd channel, two active developers were recommended by me, boosting engagement and project support.\n\nA common process for resolving longstanding issues: I initiated this process for 'Adding node for OP stack chain' and 'debug geth', addressing challenges and improving issue resolution culture.\n\nI've collected and shared questions and authoritative answers in 'wanna-techNerds', enhancing knowledge management.\n\nBeneficiaries: Developers, TechNerds Project, OP Collective.",
  "contributionDescription": "I am a member of the TechNERD program (Contribution Path Project)\nThe TechNERDS program has broadened my path of contribution \n\nKey Contributions:\n1. Recommending and bringing developers into the Wanna-TechNerd channel.\n2. Championed the implementation of a process to address long-standing issues.\n3. Collect and publish classic Q&A (with answers from OPLabs) for reuse.\n4. Initiated in-depth discussions on specialized issues through the Research Discussion Threads.\n\nAddressing Duplicate Rewards:\nThe contribution's I'm highlighting in this application are above and beyond the TechNERD contribution path's scope of work.\nSoyboy, the primary steward of the TechNERD program, has attested to how I have gone beyond the baseline requirements of the program.",
