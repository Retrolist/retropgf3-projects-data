My article on how gas work is used as a reference for gas in openzeppelin: https://s.ska.sh/zeppelin-ronan\n\n4. ERC-1155 (co-author) stands as one of the 3 main token standard\n\n5. ERC-2771 (co-author)  is used across the industry for meta-tx, including Biconomy and Gelato that run on Optimism.",
