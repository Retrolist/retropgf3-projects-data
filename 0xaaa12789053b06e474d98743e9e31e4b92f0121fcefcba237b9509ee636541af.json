  "impactDescription": "-  We were able to help propagate the Optimistic Vision and mission to a community of Hungarian readers / speakers via newsletter and social media amplification\n- We have a small but regular readership, which probably reflects the population of Hungary; approximately 9.7 million people.\n- There is presently only a small tangible measurement of the impact that we had on Optimism however in an intangible sense knowing that no language or community will be left behind a barrier, such as language, no matter how small the reach, makes the wider web3 global community feel like a diverse, inclusive space.\n- I'm Optimistic that more Hungarian readers will access and perhaps mint these articles going forward.\n",
  "contributionDescription": "We have helped solve part of the language barrier to entry of Hungarian speakers, readers by providing translations of Optimism articles and other quality Web3/ crypto educational material, like that produced by from Bankless.com and Bankless DAO from English into Hungarian.",
