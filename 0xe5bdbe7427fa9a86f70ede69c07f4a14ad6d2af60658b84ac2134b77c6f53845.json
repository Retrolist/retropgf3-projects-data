  "impactDescription": "The Goerli testnet is still the most frequented public Ethereum testnet by all metrics, seeing more than 240 million transactions and 28 million active accounts. The optimistic Goerli testnet has seen 30 million transactions with over 4 million active accounts. The events we organize host roughly 1000 hackers and attendees. Our social media community has 11k followers.",
  "contributionDescription": "The Department of Decentralization is a collective of people from various crypto- and blockchain communities in and around Berlin. The group assembled to organize events like ETHBerlin, Protocol Berg, or GoerliCon and has been providing infrastructure such as the Goerli and now the Holešky testnet.\n\nWe aim to be an agnostic vehicle to drive adoption, educate newcomers, and raise awareness of the challenges and benefits of decentralization and open-source software.\n\nOptimism benefits from public infrastructure such as the Goerli testnet, which has been the primary layer-1 for the optimistic Goerli testnet in the past year.  In addition, the Optimism Foundation has been represented at the past year's ETHBerlin and Protocol Berg.",
