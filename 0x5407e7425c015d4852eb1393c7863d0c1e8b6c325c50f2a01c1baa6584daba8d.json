  "impactDescription": "Since the Fe compiler targets EVM, developers can write Fe code for Ethereum or any EVM-equivalent platform. Fe support's a number features that developers have come to love. That list includes things like, enums and pattern matching, libraries and modules, a standard library, traits, built-in testing, and more. By improving languages we are able to improve the ecosystem as a whole.",
  "contributionDescription": "Fe is a high-level language for the EVM. It is heavily inspired by Rust and implemented in it too. You can use Fe to write smart contracts for Ethereum or any EVM-equivalent platform. Developers who have come to appreciate Rust will enjoy many of the features currently supported by Fe.",
