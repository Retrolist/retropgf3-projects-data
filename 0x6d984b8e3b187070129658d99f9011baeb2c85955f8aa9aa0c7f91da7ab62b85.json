  "impactDescription": "- The original idea to build the website came after reading a feedback thread on the forum and getting the impression that many find it difficult to keep up to date with information about grants (\"adhering to the deadlines often required navigating a maze of forum posts\")\n\n- With more than 7900 unique website visitors and 1840 outbound link clicks in the last 3 months, the site has played a key role in helping many (prospective) grantees, developers and governance participants stay informed about recent updates and upcoming deadlines of the grant programs\n\n- Subscribers to the weekly newsletter include employees from OpenZeppelin, OP Labs, Wakeup Labs, â€¦\n\n- Governance Forum thread has 593 views and a total of 31 likes\n",
  "contributionDescription": "- Changelog\nLaunched a changelog documenting the frequent changes and updates to the grant programs of the Optimism Collective\n\n- Status Overview\nBuilt a status section providing an overview of the different Collective Grants types, their current status (Open for applications, Closed for applications, ...), and upcoming deadlines\n\n- Optimism Grants Calendar\nReleased a grants calendar that goes beyond the scope of the general-purpose Governance Calendar maintained by the Optimism Foundation\n\n- Launched a FAQ section on the website answering questions related to the grant programs\n\n- Produced 8 weekly updates summarizing recent changes and upcoming deadlines, distributed via newsletter and Governance Forum thread\n",
