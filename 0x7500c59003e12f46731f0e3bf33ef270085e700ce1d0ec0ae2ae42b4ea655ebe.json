  "impactDescription": "Optimism's smart contracts are currently tested in Foundry. As the premiere Solidity testing tool, smart contract products built on OP Mainnet and other OP Stack chains are also tested with Foundry. We think Foundry as critical infrastructure for the OP ecosystem's in-so far success and for the future.",
  "contributionDescription": "Foundry is a robust, fast, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development, written in Rust. It comprises several components: Forge, an Ethereum testing framework, Cast, a versatile tool for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and retrieving chain data; Anvil, a local Ethereum node akin to Ganache and Hardhat Network; and Chisel, a Solidity REPL. \nFoundry is designed to be highly configurable, it supports fast and flexible compilation pipelines, automatic Solidity compiler version detection and installation and caching and parallel compilation, among other features. \nTests can be written in Solidity. It offers fast fuzz testing with shrinking of inputs and printing of counter-examples. \nFoundry also provides fast remote RPC forking mode",
