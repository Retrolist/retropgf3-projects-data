  "impactDescription": "We are pushing for real world adoption when possible. We encourage L2 payments on the ground without being guided by the core team. \nWe have scaled from a hackers congress to ETHPrague, to EthereumZuri.ch, and continue to educate and grow the ecosystem in Europe. ",
  "contributionDescription": "At Duct Tape, we are enabling the Optimism and Ethereum communities to grow into a way thatâ€™s aligned with our core values. Out of the 9 events we organized in the past, we accepted only support from Ethereum-aligned groups, excluding most alt L1 and venture. Hackers receive free event access, underscoring our focus on empowering builders within the community. At ETHPrague 2023, we proudly had support from the Optimism ecosystem as a sponsor, and utilized Base as a payment system on-site. Karl Floersch delivered a talk on the superchain and its developer implications. Notably, we facilitated coffee and merchandise payments through Optimism, enhancing user experience.",
