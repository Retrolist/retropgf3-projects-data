These profiles have the option to deploy an ERC-4337 passkey account.",
  "contributionDescription": "Forum Passkey Wallet:\n\n- In April this year we were the first team to launch a passkey wallet to a mainnet (Polygon for cheapest gas, since p256 signatures were expensive).\n\n- We are active members of the Account Abstraction & ERC-4337 communities, and regularly assist other teams with information regarding passkeys, webauthn, and ERC-4337 accounts.\n\n- Our contracts are open source, this includes our individual & group ERC-4337 passkey wallets, and all of our test utils for generating passkey signatures in Foundry. These tests are regularly shared in the 4337 mafia telegram group, and are used by a number of teams in the AA/Modular Account space.",
